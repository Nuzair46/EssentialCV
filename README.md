# EssentialCV
----------
##Author: Rednek46 - Nuzair Rasheed
---------------------------------
* This is a simplified module for the great OpenCV Library.
* Most of the essential functions in the library are condensed to a minimal and easy to understand code.
	
* This project is usefull for simple and small works only. 
* Some Functions use values that cannot be passed while calling. These values are from OpenCV library
	that do not have a huge impact on simple usage.
		example: `cv.threshold(frame, th1, th2, cv.THRESH_BINARY)`
		Here everything except cv.THRESH_BINARY can be passed while calling the function.

###In this module:
* Image will be sometimes reffered as Frame or img.
* Threshold will be called thresh
* Blank is a blank image used for masking.
* My personal best methods for different functions will be mentioned.
	
###Requirements:
* OpenCV
* Matplotlib
* Numpy (included with OpenCV)
